Elements have default positions that do not overlap.
The 'static' value of a position will reset the element to its default position value.
Use of the 'top' and etc properties will not move an element with the position value of static.
The relative in the 'relative' value refers to the default value for the position of an element.
The 'absolute' value allows for overlapping of elements on the page.
The 'absolute' value should also allow an element to be scrolled by.
Meanwhile, 'fixed' values for positions keep an element scrolling with the user.
